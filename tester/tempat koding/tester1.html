	<h2>how love comes</h2>
	<p><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes us experience love?</i></b> Passionate love is developed as a result of feelings that lead<br>to sexual attraction, physical interest and romance. “When you see someone you like, you are c<br>aptivated by something that draws you to that person,” explained Henry. “The attraction is phys<br>ical, and there is a fascination with the hair, eyes and body.”</p>
	<h2>How do love begin?</h2>
	<p><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling in love typically begins</i></b> when someone starts to see another person as special and uniq<br>ue.The initial phase of falling in love is an extreme neurobiological state, characterised by height<br>ened responses and high passion.</p>
